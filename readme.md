# SRE Path: Observability and Chaos Engineering

This curriculum is organized into modules that can be followed at your own pace.

---

## 1. Foundations and Strategy
Understand the business impact of reliability and how to measure what matters.
- **Fundamentals:** [SRE Basics and SLOs](/01-foundations/fundamentals.md)
